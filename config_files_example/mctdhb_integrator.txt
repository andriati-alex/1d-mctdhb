# INTEGRATION FILE SETUP
# ======================
#
# Time integration type as:
# 10 - imaginary time for ground state convergence
# 11 - real time for dynamics of initial state
10
#
# Coefficients integration method as:
# 20 - Short Iterative Lanczos(SIL) with customizable order
# 21 - Runge-Kutta following the global integrator order
20
#
# Orbital integration method as:
# 30 - Full equation Runge-Kutta approach following the global integrator order
# 31 - Split-Step with nonlinear using Runge-Kutta method
30
#
# Specific approach to handle derivatives:
# 300 - Discrete Variable Representation(DVR)
# 301 - Fourier Transforms
# 302 - Finite differences (2nd order schemes)
302
#
# Global Runge-Kutta order wherever it is used:
# 2 - Suitable for imaginary time with split-step method
# 4 - Still not so good for real time with full equation Runge-Kutta
# 5 - Suitable for real time calculations with full equation Runge-Kutta

#
# Type of boundary conditions:
# 1000 - Hard wall zero boundaries
# 1001 - Periodic boundary conditions
1001
#
# Number of Lanczos iterations to use in SIL method for coefficients
# 2~15
