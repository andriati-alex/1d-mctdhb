# CONFIGURATION FILE FOR MONITORING INTEGRATION PROGRESS
# ======================================================
#
# Set how to handle if multiple jobs are present
# 0 => Common input always using job1
# 1 => Use job number according to line of parameters
# 2 => Use output of last job (analytic continuation)
1
#
# Choose how many steps to wait to evaluate monitoring routines
10
#
# Enable (1) or disable(0) verification for convergence in imag time
1
#
# Choose how many digits needed to stabilize the energy in imag time (up to 13)
12
#
# Choose Max eigenvalue residue rolerance (recommended 0.01 ~ 0.00001)
1E-2
#
# Boolean(1) to evaluate fixed basis diagonalization if not converged
1
#
# Choose how many steps to wait to record real time step data
100
#
# Max accepted overlap residue to DON'T use inverse overlap matrix in projector
1E-8
#
# Regularization factor to avoid singular density matrix
1E-8
